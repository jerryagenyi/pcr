# File Naming Conventions

This document defines the file and folder naming conventions for the Personal Context Repository (PCR). All contributors and AI agents must follow these rules to ensure consistency, clarity, and ease of automation.

## General Rules
- Use hyphens (`-`) for Markdown documentation files (e.g., `ubuntu-server-complete-guide.md`).
- Use descriptive, full names instead of abbreviations (e.g., `professional-identity-coaching` not `prof-id-coach`).
- Use lowercase for file names (e.g., `style-guide.md`, not `StyleGuide.md`).
- Use Title Case for folder names (e.g., `ContentVault/`, `Agents/`).
- Avoid spaces, ampersands, or special characters in file and folder names. Use hyphens or underscores if needed.
- For scripts and code, use snake_case (e.g., `sync_repository.py`).
- For configuration and workflow files, use lowercase and hyphens or underscores (e.g., `security-standards.md`, `sync-gdrive-github.json`).
- For trackers, use descriptive names and appropriate extensions (e.g., `social-media-metrics.xlsx`).

## Examples
- `ubuntu-server-complete-guide.md`
- `content-strategy.md`
- `professional-identity-coaching/`
- `agents/n8n-workflows/sync-gdrive-github.json`
- `contentvault/trackers/social-media-metrics.xlsx`
