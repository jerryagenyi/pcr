# Logo Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for the consistent use of Jeremiah Agenyi's logo across all platforms and materials. Proper logo usage ensures brand recognition and maintains professional presentation.

## Primary Logo

The primary logo consists of a stylized "JA" monogram paired with the full name "Jeremiah Agenyi" and the tagline "AI for Social Impact."

### Clear Space

Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "J" in the monogram. This space should be free from text, graphics, and other elements that might visually compete with the logo.

### Minimum Size

To ensure legibility, the logo should never appear smaller than:
- 1 inch (25.4mm) wide in print materials
- 100 pixels wide for digital applications

For very small applications where the full logo would be illegible, use only the monogram element.

### Color Variations

The logo is available in the following color variations:

1. **Full Color**: Primary brand colors on light background
2. **Reversed**: White logo on dark background or brand color
3. **Monochrome**: Black logo for one-color applications
4. **Grayscale**: For black and white printing

Always use the appropriate version for the application context.

## Logo Placement

### Website

- The logo should appear in the top left corner of the website header
- Footer usage should be the monogram only
- Favicon should use the monogram element

### Social Media

- Profile pictures should use the monogram on a colored background
- Cover images may incorporate the full logo with appropriate clear space
- The logo should be centered when used as a profile picture

### Print Materials

- The logo should appear on the front cover of all print materials
- For multi-page documents, a smaller version may appear in the header or footer
- Business cards should display the logo prominently on the front
