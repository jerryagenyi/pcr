# ContextDoc: Jeremiah Agenyi's AI Strategy for Career Reinvention

## 1. Background and Career Goals

Jeremiah Agenyi is a strategic communications and digital marketing expert with a Master's in Digital Marketing from The University of Salford, UK (June 2024). Initially trained in Geology (B.Tech, Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria, 2009), he pivoted to communications, leveraging his storytelling, design, and technology skills to drive social impact (redacted: Geology was tough to break into, so I chose communications for its lower barrier to entry—my skills fit naturally, but I worry it makes me seem less deliberate). Over a decade, he's excelled in web design, graphic design, and live video production, with a passion for cost-effective, innovative solutions.

Key achievements include growing the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control's (NCDC) digital presence (Twitter from <1,000 to over 1 million followers, 2017-2020) as Communications Manager and enhancing public health communication as a World Bank REDISSE Project Consultant. Recent roles as a Digital Marketing Specialist and WordPress Web Developer (see CV and LinkedIn, March 2025) have deepened his technical expertise. Jeremiah aims to become a thought leader in AI for nonprofit technology, blending his multidisciplinary skills with a DIY/modular approach to bridge AI advancements and social good (redacted: I've always wanted to be a thought leader, but hustling drained my energy for it—AI's rise is my chance to shine).

### Career Goals:
- **Thought Leadership**: Become a recognized expert in AI policy and nonprofit technology.
- **Unique Edge**: Combine communications, design, and tech skills with a practical, modular mindset to maximize nonprofit impact.
- **Target Audience**: Nonprofit tech professionals in the UK, US, and Africa.

### Personal Philosophy:
Jeremiah champions a DIY/modular approach, believing it drives cost-effectiveness and empowers individuals to shape their personal, professional, or organizational identity. By staying deeply involved in creation and automation processes, even when outsourcing, he ensures outcomes authentically reflect his vision. This is critical in the AI era, where evolving fundamentals demand adaptable, user-centric solutions (redacted: I worry my DIY focus makes me think small, but it's my edge—nonprofits love affordable solutions).

### Note on DIY Limitation:
DIY showcases resourcefulness but can limit scale if overemphasized. To stay mindful:
- **Identity Amplifier**: Sends monthly reminders to balance DIY with scalability.
- **Progress Keeper**: Logs this as a recurring reflection in the plan's calendar.
- **Physical Note**: Jeremiah may add it to his workspace (e.g., Notion, sticky note).

## 2. Current Strategy and Interests

- **AI Policy Research**: Studying ethical AI adoption (e.g., GDPR), risks, and integration for nonprofits.
- **Technical Exploration**: Tracking AI tools (n8n, Tines, LangChain), VPS hosting, and protocols (MCP, Agent2Agent).
- **Engagement**: Writing articles, attending AI events (UK, US, Africa), speaking at conferences, and curating past work to contextualize his journey (redacted: I want this curation for my own context, but it can sell me better if shared strategically).

## 7. Guiding Principles (Final Thoughts)

To ensure success, Jeremiah's plan is built on practicality and modularity:

1. **Start Small**: Focus on Short-Term goals (Event Scout, Career Pathfinder, Content Crafter, Security Sentinel) to build momentum without overwhelm.
2. **Leverage DIY Edge**: Frame your DIY philosophy as "Practical AI for Social Good," making solutions accessible to nonprofits while exploring scalability (e.g., Tines for clients).
3. **Iterate and Reflect**: Use Progress Keeper to track progress and Identity Amplifier to refine self-perception, countering perfectionism with praise and feedback.
4. **Stay Grounded**: Grind with n8n for learning, test Tines for client demos, and let Jerry's Core Companion chat to refine ideas—your decision-making strength shines through iteration.
5. **Avoid Abandonment**: Prioritize achievable milestones (e.g., 2 articles, 1 event) and reassess agent complexity in 6 months to stay on track.

## 8. File Synchronization

To maintain consistency across the project:
1. Follow the cursor rules defined in `@docs/cursor-rules.md`
2. Ensure all AI agents and human contributors adhere to the synchronization guidelines
3. Use the `@` prefix when referencing documents in the project
4. Maintain bidirectional links between related documents
5. Update all affected files when making changes
