## **AI: More Than Just Code – Why Everyone Needs a Reality Check**

### **Why Everyone, Especially Those Doing Good, Needs to Look Up**

I just watched a video that got me thinking... It was from Uncle Stef, a brilliant, seasoned developer who’s refreshingly current and genuinely understands the journey of anyone navigating the tech world today. His take on the future of development got me thinking beyond just coders and about how these massive tech shifts impact *everyone*, especially those dedicated to making a difference in nonprofits, public health, and small businesses.

It’s easy to get caught up in the jargon – **LLMs**, **Agentic AI**, **MCPs**, oh my\! – and feel like AI is just something for the tech elite. (Quick definitions: **LLMs**, or Large Language Models, are the AI programmes that understand and generate human-like text; **Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals; and **MCPs**, or Model Context Protocols, are a new way for AI to connect securely with external data and tools). But honestly, the changes happening are fundamental, reaching into every sector, from how small businesses operate to how non-profits deliver services and how public health initiatives are managed. It's a new era of work, and whether you’re a developer or delivering vital community programmes, it's relevant.

**The Video That Sparked the Discussion (And Why It Matters Beyond Tech)**

Uncle Stef, whose insights from years in the development trenches are gold (check out his world at [Uncle Stef's Developers Bootcamp](https://www.unclestef.com/)), recently posted a video where he talked about the significant transformation happening in software development. He believes we're seeing a shift as big as the move to the web, driven by AI, low-code, and no-code platforms. While he was speaking to developers, his core message – understand these powerful new tools because they are changing the game for everyone – is universal. He wasn't just saying 'learn to code with AI'; he was saying 'understand these capabilities' because they are creating opportunities in unexpected places, including within the social impact sector.

**The Comment That Proves the Point (Bless Their Cotton Socks)**

Then came this comment on his video, which, while focused on coding, perfectly illustrates a resistance to change that you see across many fields, including sometimes in nonprofits grappling with adopting new technologies:

"I don’t really get this AI hype. To be fair, LLMs are really a better search engine. They haven’t brought anything to the table which you couldn’t do before... I have been coding for over 15 years and the way I have been coding has always been kind of a copy paste from Google or stack overflow... This is really the same way I use LLMs today... In general I disagree with you uncle Steff. I don’t believe you need to start using these technologies in order to not get left behind... What really matters is your skill of solving problems. Don’t believe the hype that LLMs are so much better than humans in coding... Understand what an LLM is, learn to think and use your brain, learn to code. You will be far ahead of any vibe coder in the future"

See what I mean? The "it's just a better version of what we had," the reliance on established methods ("copy paste from Google or Stack Overflow"), the dismissal of new tools because "what really matters is your skill" – you hear variations of this in every industry facing technological disruption. It's a mindset that can hold back progress, especially for organisations that need innovative solutions to maximise their impact.

**Beyond the Search Bar: AI's Real Impact for Good**

Calling AI, specifically LLMs, just a "better search engine" is like calling a smartphone just a "better telephone." It fundamentally misses the point, especially when you consider its potential for social good.

For a nonprofit, AI isn't just about finding information faster; it's about:

* **Automating repetitive tasks:** Freeing up valuable staff time for mission-critical work, not data entry or scheduling.  
* **Personalising donor communications:** Crafting appeals that resonate more deeply, leading to increased engagement and contributions.  
* **Analysing impact data:** Gaining deeper insights into programme effectiveness to make data-driven decisions and demonstrate impact to funders.  
* **Streamlining administrative processes:** From volunteer management to grant reporting, AI can reduce administrative burden.

In public health, AI can assist in:

* **Identifying disease trends and predicting outbreaks:** Enabling proactive interventions.  
* **Personalising patient care plans:** Tailoring approaches based on vast datasets.  
* **Improving resource allocation:** Ensuring aid and information reach those most in need.

For small businesses, AI can mean:

* **Automating customer service:** Providing instant support and freeing up staff.  
* **Personalising marketing campaigns:** Reaching the right audience with the right message.  
* **Optimising inventory and supply chains:** Reducing waste and improving efficiency.

While core skills – problem-solving, critical thinking, and the essential human empathy that drives the nonprofit sector – remain paramount, AI tools are powerful allies. They offer efficiency, deeper analysis, and the ability to tackle problems in ways that weren't feasible or affordable before. This isn't just about developers copy-pasting code; it's about professionals in *all* fields, including those dedicated to social impact, leveraging intelligent tools to achieve more and amplify their good work.

**A Quick Word on "Vibe Coding" (And Why Understanding Matters)**

Let's also distinguish between genuinely leveraging AI and just "vibe-checking" it – using it superficially without understanding its potential or limitations. There is the rise of a new term called "Vibe Coding," where "vibe coders" 'speak' to AI to create things. While this highlights how accessible AI tools are becoming, some mistakenly claim it means it's suddenly easy to create complex or expert-level work, distracting from the enormous effort and foundational knowledge it truly takes to become a professional in any field.

If you're frustrated by seeing people use AI as a crutch without developing their own expertise, that's a valid concern. But that frustration should lead to an argument for *understanding* AI's ethical and practical applications and combining them with deep expertise, rather than dismissing AI's legitimate role in driving innovation and impact across industries.

This resistance, whether from a seasoned developer or a dedicated nonprofit professional, is a predictable human response to change. But as history cheerfully reminds us, resisting the tide rarely stops the ocean; it just leaves you struggling to catch your breath later.

**Closing Thoughts: Navigating the AI Tide for Greater Impact**

The reality is, AI is here, and its influence is expanding rapidly. It's not just for tech giants or coding wizards; it offers tools and opportunities that can genuinely transform how we work in nonprofits, public health, small businesses, and countless other fields focused on creating positive change.

This isn't about replacing the invaluable skills and experience you've gained working tirelessly for your cause. It's about augmenting them. It's about using intelligent tools to work smarter, reach further, and achieve greater impact with limited resources. Whether it's automating a tedious task, gaining deeper insights from your programme data, or finding new ways to connect with your community, AI offers possibilities that were science fiction not long ago.

So, instead of asking if it's just a better search engine, let's ask: How can this powerful tool help *us* do our jobs better, serve our communities more effectively, or advance our mission more sustainably?

Here are a couple of action steps for nonprofit professionals to consider:

1. **Start Small and Experiment:** Identify one small, repetitive task (like drafting initial social media posts or summarising long reports) and explore how an AI tool might help. Many user-friendly options exist, often with free tiers.  
2. **Prioritise Learning:** Dedicate a small amount of time each week to learning about AI's potential applications in the nonprofit sector. Look for webinars, articles (like this one\!), or free online resources tailored for non-technical audiences. Understanding the basics and how AI integrates with real-world problems is the first step to leveraging its power responsibly and effectively.

The future isn't about ignoring AI; it's about understanding it, experimenting with it responsibly, and figuring out how to make it work *for you* and for the greater good. Adapt and thrive? Absolutely. And that applies to all of us working to make a difference.
