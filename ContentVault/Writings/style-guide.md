# Content Style Guide: Clarity and Accessibility

This style guide outlines principles and practices for creating clear, accessible content that aligns with Jeremiah Agenyi's brand as a thought leader in AI for nonprofit technology. It serves as a reference for both human contributors and AI agents (particularly the Content Crafter) to ensure consistency and accessibility across all content.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity First
- Prioritize clear communication over technical impressiveness
- Explain complex concepts in simple, straightforward language
- Structure content logically with clear headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for easy scanning

### 2. Accessibility for All
- Write for nonprofit professionals who may not be AI experts
- Avoid unnecessary jargon and technical terminology
- Define technical terms when first used
- Use analogies and real-world examples relevant to the nonprofit sector

### 3. Engaging and Conversational
- Adopt a warm, conversational tone
- Use active voice and direct address
- Incorporate storytelling to illustrate concepts
- Balance professionalism with approachability
- Include appropriate humor to engage readers and make content relatable
- Use light-hearted analogies and occasional wit to make technical concepts more digestible

## Content Structure

### Blog Posts and Articles
- **Headlines**: Clear, specific, and benefit-focused
- **Introduction**: State the problem and why it matters to nonprofits
- **Body**: Break down complex topics into digestible sections
- **Examples**: Include real-world applications for nonprofits
- **Conclusion**: Summarize key takeaways and next steps
- **Length**: 800-1500 words for standard posts, 2000-3000 for in-depth guides

### Social Media
- **LinkedIn**: Professional but conversational, 1-3 paragraphs with clear formatting
- **Twitter**: Concise, question-based or insight-driven, with relevant hashtags
- **Video Scripts**: Conversational, with complex concepts broken down step-by-step
- **Captions**: Clear summaries that stand alone for accessibility

## Language Guidelines

### Technical Concepts
- Introduce technical terms with plain-language definitions
- Use analogies to familiar concepts when explaining new technologies
- Provide visual aids when possible (diagrams, infographics)
- Link to resources for those who want to dive deeper

### Examples:
Instead of: "Implement a transformer-based NLP model with attention mechanisms for entity extraction."
Write: "Use AI tools that can automatically identify important information in your documents, similar to how you might highlight key points in a report."

### Jargon Management
- **Avoid**: Unnecessary acronyms, industry jargon, and technical shorthand
- **Define**: All technical terms when first used
- **Substitute**: Complex terminology with plain language equivalents when possible
- **Glossary**: Consider adding a glossary for content with multiple technical terms

## Content Review Checklist

Before publishing, review content against these criteria:
- [ ] Could a nonprofit professional with limited AI knowledge understand this?
- [ ] Are all technical terms defined when first used?
- [ ] Are there real-world examples relevant to nonprofits?
- [ ] Is the structure clear with logical headings and subheadings?
- [ ] Is the tone conversational and engaging?
- [ ] Are there analogies to help explain complex concepts?
- [ ] Has unnecessary jargon been eliminated or explained?
- [ ] Is the content visually scannable (bullets, short paragraphs)?

## AI Agent Instructions

When using the Content Crafter agent, include these specific instructions:
- "Explain this concept for nonprofit professionals with limited AI knowledge"
- "Use analogies related to nonprofit operations to illustrate this point"
- "Simplify this technical explanation without losing accuracy"
- "Structure this content for maximum clarity and readability"

## Examples of Clarity in Action

### Before:
"The implementation of transformer-based NLP models with attention mechanisms enables efficient entity extraction and semantic analysis, facilitating the development of conversational agents capable of understanding contextual nuances in user queries."

### After:
"AI tools can now understand the meaning behind questions and identify important information in text. This works similar to how a skilled volunteer might read through donor emails to pick out key details—except the AI can do it much faster. This makes it possible to create chatbots that actually understand what people are asking, even when questions are phrased differently."

### Example of Appropriate Humor:

#### Before:
"Natural Language Processing models analyze semantic relationships between words to extract meaning from unstructured text data, enabling more effective information retrieval."

#### After:
"Think of AI reading text like how you read your donor emails after your morning coffee—suddenly everything makes sense! These tools can understand the meaning behind words (not just keyword matching), which means they can actually figure out what people are asking for, even when they phrase it in creative ways. It's like having an assistant who actually listens instead of just waiting for specific trigger words."

## Maintaining This Guide

This style guide should be updated when:
1. New content types are added to the strategy
2. Feedback indicates clarity issues in published content
3. New AI terminology becomes relevant to the nonprofit sector
4. Brand voice or positioning evolves

By following these guidelines, all content will reflect Jeremiah's commitment to making AI accessible and understandable for nonprofit professionals, reinforcing his brand as a thought leader who bridges technical complexity and practical application.
