## Security Configuration

```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "operation": "scan",
    "scanType": "security",
    "options": {
      "checkApiKeys": true,
      "checkEnvVars": true,
      "checkFilePermissions": true,
      "additionalChecks": {
        "dependencyVulnerabilities": true,
        "encryptionKeyRotation": true,

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependency Management

### Weekly Scans
- Automated dependency vulnerability scans every Monday
- Report generation and review process
- Critical vulnerability immediate notification

### Update Schedule
- Monthly dependency updates
- Critical security patches within 24 hours
- Major version updates quarterly

### Version Pinning Policy
- All dependencies must be pinned to specific versions
- Version updates require testing in development environment
- Document all version changes in changelog

### Compatibility Verification
- Automated compatibility testing before updates
- Manual verification for major version changes
- Rollback plan for each update

## Access Pattern Monitoring

### User Access Logging
- Log all user access attempts
- Track API key usage
- Monitor file access patterns

### Resource Usage Tracking
- Monitor API rate limits
- Track storage usage
- Log compute resource utilization

### Anomaly Detection
- Set thresholds for normal usage patterns
- Configure automated alerts for anomalies
- Define escalation procedures

### Response Automation
- Automated response to common security events
- Predefined incident response workflows
- Integration with monitoring systems

## Encryption Key Management

### Rotation Schedule
- API keys: Quarterly rotation
- Encryption keys: Monthly rotation
- Emergency rotation procedures

### Key Storage
- Encrypted key storage
- Access control for key management
- Audit logging for key access

## Incident Response

### Procedures
- Immediate incident classification
- Escalation paths defined
- Communication protocols

### Documentation
- Incident response playbooks
- Post-mortem templates
- Recovery procedures

## Implementation Tasks

### Week 4 Security Implementation
- [ ] Implement dependency scanning automation
- [ ] Setup access pattern monitoring
- [ ] Configure encryption key rotation schedule
- [ ] Test incident response automation
- [ ] Document security incident escalation procedures

## Required Files

### Workflows
- `Agents/n8n-workflows/key-rotation.json`: Encryption key rotation workflow
- `Agents/n8n-workflows/security-scan.json`: Automated security scanning workflow

### Configuration
- `Agents/configs/security-dashboard.json`: Security monitoring dashboard configuration
- `Agents/configs/incident-response.json`: Incident response automation rules

## API Credential Management

### Storage
- Store API credentials in environment variables
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use secure vault services for production

### Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
- Implement secure key management

### Access Control
- Implement least privilege principle
- Use API keys with limited scope
- Regularly audit access permissions
- Monitor for unauthorized access

## Agent Security

### Authentication
- Implement OAuth2 where possible
- Use secure token storage
- Implement token rotation
- Monitor for token abuse

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Implement data validation
- Sanitize inputs
- Log security events

## Best Practices

### Development
- Follow security by design principles
- Regular security audits
- Implement secure coding practices
- Use security linters

### Monitoring
- Log security events
- Monitor for anomalies
- Regular security updates
- Incident response plan

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Scanning
- Implement regular security scans (every 6 hours)
- Monitor for exposed API keys and credentials
- Check file permissions and access patterns
- Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Alert System
- Configure real-time alerts for security events
- Use Slack channel for security notifications
- Maintain audit logs of all security events
- Implement escalation procedures for critical issues

### Response Protocol
- Document incident response procedures
- Maintain contact list for security incidents
- Regular security incident drills
- Post-incident review and documentation
