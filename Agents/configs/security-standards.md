# Security Standards for PCR Agents

## API Credential Management

### Storage
- Store API credentials in environment variables
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use secure vault services for production

### Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Rotate encryption keys regularly
- Implement secure key management

### Access Control
- Implement least privilege principle
- Use API keys with limited scope
- Regularly audit access permissions
- Monitor for unauthorized access

## Agent Security

### Authentication
- Implement OAuth2 where possible
- Use secure token storage
- Implement token rotation
- Monitor for token abuse

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Implement data validation
- Sanitize inputs
- Log security events

## Best Practices

### Development
- Follow security by design principles
- Regular security audits
- Implement secure coding practices
- Use security linters

### Monitoring
- Log security events
- Monitor for anomalies
- Regular security updates
- Incident response plan

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Scanning
- Implement regular security scans (every 6 hours)
- Monitor for exposed API keys and credentials
- Check file permissions and access patterns
- Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Alert System
- Configure real-time alerts for security events
- Use Slack channel for security notifications
- Maintain audit logs of all security events
- Implement escalation procedures for critical issues

### Response Protocol
- Document incident response procedures
- Maintain contact list for security incidents
- Regular security incident drills
- Post-incident review and documentation
