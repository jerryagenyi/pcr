## Overview

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

CodeRabbit is an AI-powered code review tool that:

- Reviews code changes before they're shipped
- Flags hallucinations, logical errors, code smells, and missed unit tests
- Provides context-aware feedback on code design and architecture
- Integrates with both GitHub (as a bot) and VS Code (as an extension)
- Offers generous free tier limits

By integrating CodeRabbit into our workflow, we can:
- Catch issues before they reach production
- Maintain consistent code quality standards
- Reduce technical debt
- Improve security posture
- Save time on manual code reviews

## Setup Instructions

## Workflow Integration

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

To effectively use CodeRabbit in our development workflow:

### 1. Branch-Based Development

Always use Git branches for development:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make your changes
# ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. Pre-Commit Reviews

Before creating a pull request:

1. Open the CodeRabbit panel in VS Code
2. Click "Review" to analyze your changes
3. Address any issues identified by CodeRabbit
4. Commit the fixes
5. Run the review again until no issues are found

### 3. Pull Request Integration

When you create a pull request:

1. CodeRabbit will automatically review the PR
2. Review the comments from CodeRabbit
3. Address any issues in follow-up commits
4. Request human review only after addressing CodeRabbit's feedback

## Best Practices

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

To get the most out of CodeRabbit:

1. **Small, Focused Changes**: Make smaller, more focused commits and PRs for more precise feedback
2. **Regular Reviews**: Run CodeRabbit reviews frequently during development, not just at the end
3. **Document Exceptions**: When ignoring CodeRabbit advice, document why in code comments
4. **Learn Patterns**: Pay attention to recurring feedback to improve your coding habits
5. **Combine with Human Review**: Use CodeRabbit as a first pass before human code review

## GitHub Integration

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

CodeRabbit integrates with GitHub in several ways:

### Pull Request Comments

CodeRabbit will:
- Add inline comments on specific lines of code
- Provide a summary comment with an overview of issues
- Label PRs based on the severity of issues found

### Configuration

We've created a `.github/coderabbit.yaml` file in our repository to customize behavior:

```yaml
# CodeRabbit Configuration for PCR Repository
reviews:
  high_level_summary: true
  poem: true
  review_comment_lgtm: true
  collapse_walkthrough: true
  path_filters:
    - "!docs/"
    - "!*.md"
    - "**/*.py"
    - "**/*.js"
    - "**/*.json"
    - "**/*.yaml"
    - "**/*.yml"
  path_instructions:
    - path: "Agents/"
      instructions: "This directory contains agent configurations and workflows. Focus on security, API handling, and error handling. Ensure credentials are properly secured."
    - path: "Agents/n8n-workflows/"
      instructions: "These are n8n workflow definitions. Check for proper error handling, secure credential usage, and workflow efficiency."
```

The full configuration can be viewed in the `.github/coderabbit.yaml` file.

## VS Code Integration

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

The VS Code extension provides:

1. **In-Editor Reviews**: Review code without leaving your editor
2. **Inline Annotations**: See issues directly in your code
3. **Quick Fixes**: Apply suggested fixes with a single click
4. **Branch Awareness**: Automatically detects and reviews changes in your current branch

### Using the Extension

1. Make changes in a feature branch
2. Click the CodeRabbit icon in the sidebar
3. Click "Review Changes" to analyze your code
4. View issues in the Problems panel
5. Click on issues to see detailed explanations
6. Apply fixes directly or use them as guidance

## Addressing CodeRabbit Feedback

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

When CodeRabbit provides feedback:

1. **Understand the Issue**: Read the full explanation to understand the problem
2. **Consider the Context**: Evaluate if the feedback applies to your specific case
3. **Apply Fixes**: Use suggested fixes when appropriate
4. **Learn for Next Time**: Use feedback to improve your coding practices

For complex issues:

1. Use the feedback as input for your preferred AI coding assistant
2. Ask for a more detailed explanation if needed
3. Research the issue to understand best practices

## Integration with N8N Workflows

[↑ Return to Top](#table-of-contents)

We can integrate CodeRabbit with our N8N workflows to automate parts of our development process:

### 1. PR Status Notification Workflow

Create an N8N workflow that:
- Triggers when CodeRabbit completes a review
- Sends a notification to relevant team members
- Updates task status in project management tools

```
Trigger: GitHub Webhook (PR review completed)
↓
Filter: Only CodeRabbit reviews
↓
HTTP Request: Get PR details
↓
Conditional: Based on review status
↓
Notification: Send to appropriate channels
```

Save this workflow as `Agents/n8n-workflows/coderabbit-notification.json`.

### 2. Automated Fix Verification

Create a workflow that:
- Triggers when commits are pushed to a PR after CodeRabbit review
- Runs tests to verify fixes
- Updates PR with verification results

```
Trigger: GitHub Webhook (PR updated)
↓
Filter: Only PRs with CodeRabbit comments
↓
Execute: Run test suite
↓
Conditional: Tests pass/fail
↓
GitHub: Update PR with results
```

Save this workflow as `Agents/n8n-workflows/coderabbit-verification.json`.

### 3. Weekly Code Quality Report

Create a workflow that:
- Runs on a weekly schedule
- Collects CodeRabbit review statistics
- Generates a report of common issues
- Sends the report to team members

```
Trigger: Schedule (Weekly)
↓
HTTP Request: Get GitHub PRs from the past week
↓
Loop: For each PR
  ↓
  HTTP Request: Get CodeRabbit comments
  ↓
  Function: Aggregate issues by type
↓
Function: Generate report
↓
Send: Email report to team
```

Save this workflow as `Agents/n8n-workflows/code-quality-report.json`.
